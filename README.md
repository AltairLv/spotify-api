# Spotify API: Get Recent / Current song

This project simplifies the process of getting information about the current or recently played song
( Title, Album, Artists, Album Cover ... ) on Spotify by managing access tokens, refreshing the token when necessary¬π.
A database such as Redis is used to efficiently store and retrieve access tokens. All done through Spotify's API.

1. Access Tokens last 1 hour.

_(Redis was a personal choice, I do generally recommend a normal Database)_

## ‚òëÔ∏è To-do

- [x] Fix multiple Redis instances.
- [ ] Implement Cache Manager ?
